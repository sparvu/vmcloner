=head1 NAME

VMCloner - Automation Test Utility

=head1 CONTEXT

vmcloner is a script designed to help you create, start, stop and delete mass numbers of
virtual machines, Xen or KVM based. It is 'mostly automated', meaning that you have to 
do the groundwork first, and then your server will work with this script with minimal 
interference.

It is written in perl and makes extensive use of perl modules where available, and 
system calls where not.

This readme file is designed to be read on github. It is written using github's
own flavour of markdown.
